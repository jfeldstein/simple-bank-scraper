## Simple Bank Scraper 

1. Edit native.js.coffee to user your creditials.
2. Run `phantomjs native.js.coffee` to tell you your balance


I'm interested in advanced web scraping. This is me learning phantomjs and heroku buildpacks. 

The idea was that I could put this script on heroku, then GET a simple url that would return my personal bank balance. Would like to make an android widget that displays my balance on my home screen, or a Mac menu bar widget that makes my safe-to-spend balance easy to access.
